meu_respawn
=================

This addon includes a module designed to be used with respawn enabled (respawn = 3 or "BASE"). What it does is disable the respawn so that there is only 1 life but players can still join a game in progress. After you die, depending on the module configuration you are either kicked from the game or put in spectator mode.
- Allows player reconnection and JiP
- Persist player status on reconnect
- Delete player bodies on reconnect
- Enable spectator mode on death
- Custom spectator camera using a lightly modified version of the vanilla spectator system
